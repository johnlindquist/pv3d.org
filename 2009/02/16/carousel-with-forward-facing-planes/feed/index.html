		<description>How do one add support for clickable planes, so you can rotate to the selected plane?!?</description>

		<description>This is great - solving major issue for me. One thing I can&#039;t seem to successfully manipulate is the camera rotation (though rotating the carousel would work just as well). I&#039;d like to change the perspective such that it the planes at the rear of the carousel are visible, slightly above the front most plane. Any thoughts? Much obliged, and hope things on the economic front are improving (for both you and by extension, your wife).

cheers.</description>

		<description>Yes I would also like to know how easy it would be to ass some next/previous buttons to this script. I tried out Lee Brimelow&#039;s carousel but it looks a bit outdated. Any ideas?</description>

		<description>Hi, what if I wanted to gently ease around on the animation instead of moving so precisely to the movement of my mouse? Could you give me some insight?</description>

		<description>Thank you for the example! I was trying to do this based on the previous carousel example, but this one seems more simple!</description>

		<description>Nah, I&#039;ve got plenty of ideas. I&#039;ve just been much busier in the past couple weeks than usual and this question seems to keep popping up.</description>
