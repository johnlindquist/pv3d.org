		<description>Hello, I just started playing around with PV3D and it seems really cool and i have a little question about this example.
Is it possible to find out what side of the cube that have been pressed so you can specify different behavior on the different sides?

Thank you =)</description>

		<description>wow, optical illusion really doesn&#039;t work for me. i clicked the link expecting to see it as the outside of the cube and it looked very strange (because it was showing me the &quot;inside&quot;). had to close my eyes and imagine i was actually inside for it to work</description>

		<description>I updated the example to address both of your comments. You still need to recreate the cube to take advantage of the &quot;sides&quot; parameter, but you also need to recreate the materialsList to release all the references to the old cube.</description>

		<description>oh, disregard my question above, i just realized after Andre&#039;s comments that you&#039;re removing/readding the cubes.  i think it&#039;d be a cooler effect if you just hid/unhid them so they animate the same way as i mentioned above :P</description>

		<description>when switch the cube many times, it appear that the processing go down... but you are removing it, what is going on?</description>

		<description>just curious, when you switch the views, it seems like the cube re-animates into the spot rather than just having the new other one appear where the current one sat.  why does that happen? or are my eyes playing tricks on me?</description>
