		<description>although your question is more than a year old ...&lt;br&gt;you can save the renderlist once you&#039;ve rendered all your planes and assign it back to your viewport after you&#039;ve rendered your scene with the selective methode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this.m_viewport.lastRenderList = this.m_savedLastRenderList.concat();</description>

		<description>@Augie - I&#039;d recommend adding MouseEvent handlers to the ViewportLayers. So once you roll over the viewport layer, you could start interacting with it and/or render it.</description>

		<description>@Vico: I have the same exact problem, it seems that you can only interact with objects in the last ViewportLayer that you render. Does anyone know why this is? Vico&#039;s workaround does not work for me, as I am stopping rendering on purpose, in order to tween the camera and a new 3d Object only (in order to achieve an &quot;impossible&quot; perspective). I think I might just have to make 2 papervision scenes on top of each other...</description>

		<description>Hello john, 
Thank you for all your tutorials, and congratulations on your new job. 

I have made selective renderer, on one of my projects. 
I have many planes, and I want to make a render only on the selected plane. 
So I have my listeners on all planes (OBJECT_PRESS. ..). When I click on a plane, I select the viewportlayer and render only that layer. It works very well ... 
Except that I lose the interactivity on all my other planes ... 
I found a &quot;temporary&quot; solution, I make a render of all my planes once the animation of the selected plane over. 
Interactivity on each plane returns. 
But it made me a more render... 

I do not understand why listeners disappear when plane does not render ... 

Do you have an idea where this might come?
maybe I did the wrong way ?</description>

		<description>Hey John, glad to see you blogging again!

So even though you&#039;re extending BasicView, this line -  
renderer.renderLayers(scene, camera, viewport, rightLayers);

is necessary to get to the specified layer? Can&#039;t you do-

startRendering(rightLayers); ?</description>

		<description>Thanks again John.  What if I were to want to index sort two viewports, render the back viewport once b/c it doesn&#039;t change but not the front viewport?  Is that possible with viewport layers or would they have to be two separate viewports rendered differently?</description>
