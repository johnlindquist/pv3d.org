		<description>I am trying to rotate a sphere in a similar fasion to the arrow in the middle of this example. Problem is when I apply this code (as with other solutions I have found) they only seem to work on objects which are positioned in the world at 0,0,0. When I apply it to offset objects or worse still nested objects although it does follow a central rotation it seems the axis rotation is out. I have tried playing with Matrix3D.rotateAxis but to be honest I have no idea what I am doing! Getting desperate now can anybody help out?</description>
