		<description>I very appreciate your Math tutorials They help much to upgrade programming capabilities. I would like to ask a question : Is that true to say that
that do3d.transform.copy copies only the direction vector and do3d.transform.copy3x3 copies direction and translation? That is what I understand after I tried to use copy instead copy3x3 The result was my camera rotated in the same direction as the selected object. Thanks in advance!</description>

		<description>Hey , very nice example  , is  it possible to get a source code? . And I have got a question:If I want to transform one object so that it gets the direction and rotation of the other object the Slerp is the ultimate tool for this?</description>
