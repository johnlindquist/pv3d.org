		<description>You could create your HUD in another scene and another viewport in front of your objects viewport. Also, to improve performace, create a BasicRenderEngine and do the render for both viewport and scenes. This is my workaround. cheers</description>

		<description>well, I would of thought of the viewport layer something like a HUD but it is not. It is really weird to have this layer as from the name it means that objects belong to the viewport but in reality they do not. I am still tryign to find a better way to create HUDs in papervision (I do not mean 2D Display object huds) but also 3D huds.</description>
