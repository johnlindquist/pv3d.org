		<description>Hi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a great example. However - I can&#039;t seem to get shading to apply when I try it. Have there been any changes in the library that might affect this? How can I reapply shading to the plane?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks</description>

		<description>I have been using the as3dmod perlin modifier to create a wave and was wondering if you know how to slow down the speed of the wave and increase the amplitude. I&#039;ve played around with the actionscript library but haven&#039;t produced any noticeable changes when it&#039;s rendered. Any help will be greatly appreciated</description>

		<description>This example doesn&#039;t work with (what I assume to be) the latest versions of PV3D and AS3Dmod... specifically the gouraud shading. Is there something that needs to be changed for it to work? The perlin ripple effect still works fine.</description>

		<description>I was just having a play with perlin and I came across a problem; how to ease up and down the force on the perlin effect. I think its connected to its auto render feature which denies me a handle from the stack, but its got me stumped. ps thanks for all the tuts and I hope you get a kick arse job</description>

		<description>It looks really cool with the Goraud shader! I never tried that one before.</description>
