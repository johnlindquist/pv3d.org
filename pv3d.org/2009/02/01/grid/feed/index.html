		<description>I was wondering a way to generate the number of rows and columns dynamically based on the number of items i want to create. Example, i want to create a 12 item grid, so it is 4 rows and 3 columns or 3 columns and 4 rows. &lt;br&gt;Still trying it, as soon as i have the answer, i&#039;ll post it here</description>

		<description>Hello this website is awesome.

I&#039;m new in papervision 3d and as3. But i have expertice in java, and actionscript 2, For this reason object and classes syntaxis is easy to understand and the basics for as3 in flash to. 

I was playing with this example, and i have the next question.

I did a change in the line:

TweenMax.to(selectedPlane, 1, {scale:2, rotationY:180});
	
For
			TweenLite.to(selectedPlane, 1, {scale:5,rotationY:180, x:100,y:100});

The reason is, TweenLite is only 2k library. Also i want to open the plane in the same position each time. The problem is, when i clicked the plane, works fine, but for each click, the render process doesn&#039;t work well. The other planes disapear or change the original shape.

I want to know wat is the problem?

Thank you, 
I apreciates to much the work done here.</description>

		<description>Ugo, I had the same question.  The polygonal site has some explanation behind the package as well as a link to the documentation.  I&#039;m trying to wrap my head around it...

		<description>Thanks for this. Can you suggest any other tutorials or reading material to help me understand the polygonal data structure library? It all seems like dark magic at the moment.</description>
