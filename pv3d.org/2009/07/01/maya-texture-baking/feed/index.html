&lt;p&gt;I think you&#039;ve got some interesting points, but I&#039;m just not sold. If you really want to get the crowd behind you, you&#039;ve got to entertain us, man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>I think an extent of five months has been enough to find the solution. Even then, I think you should try the most basic thing, REPAIR (or Re-install) .</description>

		<description>I think its cause your texture source is not present in the computer you are opening in . To &quot;open it again any where else&quot; and find your textures the way they are , you&#039;ll have to carry your texture files that have been used as maps. Actually the problem is simple. The &quot;any where else&quot;-computer does not have the textures you&#039;ve used in your scene, so they can not be seen.         Hope I&#039;m right .</description>
