		<description>I&#039;m amazed but not shocked; a similar thing happened at the same time to one of my best friends, a senior planner who is, like you, a genius.  your firm and his are thinking only short term.
What really sucks is the short term impact these occurances has on families.  May you find support all around you to relieve any associated stress.</description>

		<description>Good luck, man. This is why we need health insurance for everyone, not just as a &quot;bonus&quot; to attract talent. As business conditions change (and they ALWAYS do) your talent may appear less important to your employers. The previous condition situation (like your wife&#039;s) that insurance companies use to weed out people who need insurance is just plain immoral.</description>
