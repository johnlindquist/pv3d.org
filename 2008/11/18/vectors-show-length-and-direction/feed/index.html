		<description>Hi!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#039;m trying to calculate 3D position of a mouse click position by detected marker&#039;s plane. Is there any easy way to find 3D postion on the marker&#039;s plane? I&#039;ve tried to intersect 2D position with marker&#039;s plane. I can get the ray vector fo the mouse click position by flarCamera3D&#039;s unproject method. I also can get the marker&#039;s 3D position. But I need to find the normal vector of the marker&#039;s plane. So I can build a plane3D with setNormalAndPoint method. Then I can intersect the ray with this plane and the result will be the 3D position of the 2D mouse position.My codes are here:var ray:Number3D = flarCamera3D.unproject(mouse.x,mouse.y);var p:Plane3D = new Plane3D();var normal: Number3D = I DONT KNOW HOW TO FIND??p.setNormalAndPoint(normal, markerPosition);var intersect:Number3D = p.getIntersectionLineNumbers(flarCamera3D.position, ray);&lt;br&gt;</description>
