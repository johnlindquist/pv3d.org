		<description>When I run this code I get the following error&lt;br&gt;&quot;TypeError: Error #1007: Instantiation attempted on a non-constructor.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess it has something to do with &quot;var santaBitmap:Bitmap = new santaAsset() as Bitmap;&quot;&lt;br&gt;But I&#039;m not sure.&lt;br&gt;Maybe it&#039;s the program I use? -&gt; flash 9.0 CS3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any of you guys have an idea?</description>

		<description>The null problem was my fault.  I tried to declare it before it was loaded.  I&#039;d still love to see the video you&#039;re talking about here though.  It&#039;s even one step harder to learn Papervision3D when you have to set up all of the Flex examples to Flash.</description>

		<description>Unlike most of your examples, this did not compile correctly in flash cs3.  I&#039;m getting a different error  at runtime though.  #1009 null object reference.  did you ever make the video tutorial about importing your examples to flash?  I&#039;ve not had a problem yet doing that with your examples until now.  thanks for all you&#039;ve taught me.</description>

		<description>im having an issue with all types of shaders. as soon as i apply a shaded material to my planes which are set up in the shape of a cube they all seem to get bigger.

any ideas why?</description>

		<description>Hi John! You&#039;re examples are awesome!
I have one issue here, however. I&#039;ve implemented this solution in a project, where the plane can turn all the way around and the light doesn&#039;t seem to interact with the back face although the bitmap is visible.
I&#039;ve set doubleSided to true for both the BitmapMaterial and the ShadedMaterial. When I set it for the PhongShader it throws an error (==undefined property).
Keep up the good work!</description>

		<description>@Phil - I imagine you&#039;re using Flash instead of FlexBuilder. I&#039;ll be putting together a video tutorial of how to import the examples into Flash when I get back home next week.</description>

		<description>Heya, i&#039;ve got a problem over here!
When i&#039;m exporting my swf i&#039;ve got  Error #1007 output. 
The thing is it does that even with your original source code... Any tips on that?</description>

		<description>I really like that your examples are written in OOP. This is important for people who are new to AS3. I also like the simple example illustrating shading material. I wish, though, that your examples would have more comments in the code. Keep it up!</description>
