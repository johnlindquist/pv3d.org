		<description>hi,I found your website and it helps me a lot.
But I have a question about this tutorial. Is that a real video plane? 

Is it can play the video on the Material of the plane?</description>

		<description>hi,

i copied and pasted you example, made a square movieclip class name theoffice... i&#039;m using flash and what i see is that when the videio is visible is in the topLeft, but the plane tweens to the center of the screen. Any ideas on why this is happening?</description>

		<description>But MovieMaterial creates the Bitmap from the DisplayObject for me.  ;)  I haven&#039;t mastered Flex/Flash yet but it seems tweens on native text, which naturally the Panels contain, don&#039;t always work well (e.g. alpha tweens).  I will continue to look at it and post any noob revelations.  Thanks.</description>

		<description>Well, technically, a Bitmap is a DisplayObject. So a BitmapMaterial should be fine if you don&#039;t need any animation.


I&#039;ve never actually snapshotted a UIComponent into a BitmapMaterial before. I imagine you would have to wait for one of the Flex framework&#039;s events to fire off before you could pull out the proper BitmapData from the panel.


If I get some time, I&#039;ll play around with the idea, I&#039;m pretty slammed with work right now though :(</description>

		<description>Hi John,
Using Flex, I want to add tunnel-like navigation, using Panel objects.  User clicks the bitmap copy in the background, it moves forward, the real Panel is displayed and the bitmap copy is hidden.  I am having trouble getting the bitmap copy to display initially but the question is: Would I also use a MovieMaterial for this, since it appears to be the only material that accepts a DisplayObject?</description>

		<description>@Kyle - Yeah, I know, I&#039;m an idiot. 
&lt;br/&gt;
I was playing around with a moving the plane a bunch of different directions, but decided to simplify to just moving forward for the example. isMovingForward is kind of the leftover roadkill from that mess :P</description>

		<description>Great examples.  Thanks!  You could have also just done this in toggleDirection():

private function toggleDirection():void{
    isMovingForward = !isMovingForward;
}</description>

		<description>I&#039;ll add that to my list of examples to make. I need to get my hosting working on my files first.</description>

		<description>I am trying to wrap my head around the idea of using this class on multiple mc&#039;s in the same screen.
How do I override or re-use this class and apply it to other mc&#039;s?  Say the override only changing the plane.x,  plane.y, plane.z, the embededVideo var and whatever else differentiates the new object.

I want to place about six planes on the stage each in its own space with unique attributes, when clicked they perform a tween then the swap in your class, to bring up my main site areas.</description>
